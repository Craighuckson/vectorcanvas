# **App Name**: Vector Canvas

## Core Features:

- Shape Creation and Manipulation: Enable users to draw and manipulate basic vector shapes like lines, polylines, polygons, ellipses, and text elements. Support resizing, scaling and color changes for all primitives.
- Line Style Customization: Allow users to select line weight and line style between solid, dashed, and dotted strokes.
- Object Manipulation: Implement drag-and-drop functionality and rotation capabilities for all objects.
- Grouping: Implement group/ungroup functionality. Allow users to select several objects at once and group them for easier moving/deletion
- Undo/Redo: Implement an undo/redo system with at least 10 steps of history.
- Serialization: Implement serialization and deserialization features for importing and exporting drawings in JSON format.
- Custom Stamp Tool: Allow users to select objects on the canvas and save them as reusable stamps using the KonvaJS library.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A saturated teal (#46B3AC), offering a modern, calming feel reminiscent of digital creativity.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated teal (#F0F8F7) creates a soft backdrop that allows the drawn elements to stand out.
- Accent color: A vibrant lime green (#A3E47F), is analogous to teal and adds a refreshing and lively contrast.
- Clean, sans-serif font for UI elements to ensure readability.
- Use flat, minimalistic icons to represent tools and actions.
- A clean, intuitive layout that allows the canvas to take center stage, minimizing distractions.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and enhance user interaction.
